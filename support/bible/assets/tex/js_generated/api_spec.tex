\subsection{alias APIs}

Alias APIs for creating nicknames for UUIDs and other long strings
\par
The alias set of APIs provide a set of `alias' management functions for
creating and managing aliases for long strings such as UUIDs. If an alias'
name is used as a parameter value in any API call, that parameter will see
the alias' value instead. Given that references to all sentinels, walkers,
nodes, etc. utilize UUIDs, it becomes quite useful to create pneumonic
names for them. Also, when registering   sentinels, walkers, architype
handy aliases are automatically generated. These generated aliases can
then be managed using the alias APIs. Keep in mind that whenever an alias
is created, all parameter values submitted to any API with the alias name
will be replaced internally by its value. If you get in a bind, simply use
the clear or delete alias APIs.

\subsection{architype APIs}

Architype APIs for creating and managing Jaseci architypes
\par
The architype set of APIs allow for the addition and removing of
architypes. Given a Jac implementation of an architype these APIs are
designed for creating, compiling, and managing architypes that can be
used by Jaseci. There are two ways to add an architype to Jaseci, either
through the management of sentinels using the sentinel API, or by
registering independent architypes with these architype APIs. These
APIs are also used for inspecting and managing existing arichtypes that
a Jaseci instance is aware of.
