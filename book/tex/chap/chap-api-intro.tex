The primary method for executing computations using \index{Jac} and Jaseci is to submit Jac programs to a cloud service that implements the Jaseci machine.

[Benefits of doing it in the cloud, abstraction, scale, elasticity, machine configuration ease, etc]

To realize this cloud based operational and execution model a standard API interface is needed. We define this API using well established REST API principles~\cite{RESTAPIsOReilly,article_key}.
