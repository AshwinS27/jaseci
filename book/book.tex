The way we design and write software to do computation and AI sucks. It's a vat of boiling poop, mixed with pee, slowly swirling and bubbling toward that dehydrated semi-solid state of goo that serves to repel and repulse most normal people only attracting the few unfortunate-fortunate folks that happen to be obsessed with \gls{scat}.
\paragraph{}
Hrm, too much? Probably. I guess you'd expect me to use concrete examples and cite evidence to make my points, me being a professor and all. I mean, I could write something like \textit{``The fundamental imperative programming model utilized in near all of the production software produced in the last four decades has not changed since blah blah blah..."} to meet expections. I'd certainly sound more credible and perhaps super smart. Well, I'm not going to do that here. Let's have fun. Afterall, Jaseci has never been work for me, its play. Very ambitious play granted, but play at it's core.
\paragraph{}
Everything here is based on my opinion and intution. That suffices for me, and I hope it does for you. I have spent many decades coding and leading teams who code and my gut that tells me that we can do better. This is my attempt at better. I hope you find value in it. If you do, awesome! If you don't, also awesome.
