\label{rant:librariessuck}

Because they do.
\par
Still need more reasons?

Well, if you dont already know, I'm not going to tell you.

Fine, I'll tell you.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item They suck because they create dependancies for which you must have faith in the implementer of the library to maintain and keep bug free.
    \item They suck because there are often at least 10 options to choose from with near exact features expressings slightly different idosyncratic ways.
    \item They suck because they suck.
\end{enumerate}
Don't get me wrong, we have to use libraries. I'm not saying go reimplement the wheel 15 thousand times over. But that doesn't mean they don't suck and should be avoided if possible. The best is to know your library inside and out so the moment you hit some suckitude you can pull in the library's source code into your own codebase and \gls{pwn} it as your own.
