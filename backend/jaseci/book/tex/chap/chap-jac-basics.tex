Jac is dynamically typed.

Jac is pass by reference.

Jac is whitespace agnostic.

Jac does not have traditional notion of functions but walkers instead. Deliberate to encourage thought about problems in a spacial graph paradigmn that is equivilant in power but more natural for many complex AI problems.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Hello World},label={lst:hello}]
walker init {
    std.log('Hello World');
}
\end{lstlisting}

Listing~\ref{lst:hello} shows the canonical 'hello world' program as it would be most simply implemented in Jac.

Jac also has the notion of single statement line code blocks.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Hello World},label={lst:hellosingle}]
walker init: std.log('Hello World');
\end{lstlisting}


Program~\ref{lst:hello} is equivilant to Program~\ref{lst:hellosingle}.
% Chapter \ref{} describes walkers and Chapter~\ref{} describes Jac's standard library of Actions.
